 Azure Services Used:

 Azure Core Services

 1. Azure Virtual Machine:
 
Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) are on-demand, scalable computing 
resources provided by Microsoft Azure. They enable you to run virtualized 
Windows or Linux servers in the cloud. Here are some key points about Azure 
Virtual Machines

 2. Azure Monitor CPU Alert:

Creating a CPU usage alert in Azure Monitor involves several steps. Azure Monitor 
allows you to set up alerts based on various metrics, including CPU usage. Below is a 
general guide on how to create a CPU usage alert using Azure Monitor:

 Azure AI Service

 Azure AI Translator Service :
The core of the translation functionality is powered by Azure AI Translator service. This 
service employs advanced natural language processing algorithms to provide accurate 
and contextually relevant translations across a wide array of languages. Azure AI Translator Service is the engine behind the Movie Recommender System app language translation capabilities. It employs advanced natural language processing to deliver accurate and contextually relevant translations.
