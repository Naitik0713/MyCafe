## Setup:

 Azure Services Used:

 Azure Core Services

 1. Azure Virtual Machine:
 
Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) are on-demand, scalable computing 
resources provided by Microsoft Azure. They enable you to run virtualized 
Windows or Linux servers in the cloud. Here are some key points about Azure 
Virtual Machines

 2. Azure Monitor CPU Alert:

Creating a CPU usage alert in Azure Monitor involves several steps. Azure Monitor 
allows you to set up alerts based on various metrics, including CPU usage. Below is a 
general guide on how to create a CPU usage alert using Azure Monitor:

 Azure AI Service

 Azure AI QnA maker Service :
 
It leverages machine learning and natural language processing to understand user queries and provide accurate responses based on predefined knowledge bases. With Azure QnA Maker, developers can create conversational AI agents that can understand a wide range of questions and provide relevant answers in real-time. This service simplifies the process of building chatbots, virtual assistants, and other interactive applications, empowering businesses to enhance customer service, streamline support processes, and automate repetitive tasks.
